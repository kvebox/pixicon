## Pixicon
[Live Demo](http://pix-icon.herokuapp.com/)

### Background and Overview
Pictionary is a browser based drawing game similar to the classic multiplayer game Pictionary. Each player is given a turn as the 'artist', where he/she draws a word which the other players attempt to guess. The correct guess merits the player points, the amount depending on whether other players had previously guessed correctly. The player with the most points at the end of all rounds wins the game.
